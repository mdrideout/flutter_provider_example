# Flutter Provider Example

This project is based on the starting point for a flutter application.

## Improvements
The starting point has been refactored to utilize Provider for state management.

- State is managed with Provider
- The counter is refactored into a separate widget file, setup as a Consumer
- The counter and counterData model is setup to be more extensible, as an example for more complex data
